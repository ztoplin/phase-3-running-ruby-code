# puts "Hello, world!"

# # also can be written as, as using parentheses when invoking a method is optional:

# puts("Hello, world!")

# puts "Hello, world!"

# # 'puts' adds a line break to the end of the string, whereas 'print' will not

# print "Hello, world!"
# print "Hello, world!"
# print "Hello, world!"


# puts [1, 2, 3]


# # This is the equivalent of calling:
# # puts [1, 2, 3].inspect 

# p [1, 2, 3]


# # pp, 'pretty-printing', is used for complex data such as nested arrays and hashes (the Ruby equivalent of JavaScript objects). it is calling the .pretty_inspect method

# pp [{ id: 1, hello: "World"}, { id: 2, hello: "Ruby"}, {id: 3, hello: "Moon"}, {id: 4, hello: "Learner"}]

puts "Hello World!\n"

print "Pass this test, please."

p [1,2,3]
